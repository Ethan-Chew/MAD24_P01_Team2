# Study Statistic - Darius Koh

**Study Statistic** is for users to view their overall usage of the app. This feature allows users to view how long they have spent using the app. How long was spent on the flashlets and flashcards. It is also shown in a weekly format, which shows both the total time spent on the app, and the daily average in the past week.
