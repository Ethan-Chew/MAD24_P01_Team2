# Study Statistic - Darius Koh

**Study Statistic** is for users to view their overall usage of the app. This feature allows users to view how long they have spent using the app. How long was spent on the flashlets and flashcards. It is also shown in a weekly format, which shows both the total time spent on the app, and the daily average in the past week.

## Statistics Page

- This screen showcases the amount of time spent on the app weekly.
- The top of the screen is the back button followed by the "Statistics" title at the top.
- Then below that is the weekly graph of the time spent on the app, with the daily average at the topr right side, and how much additional or less the user has used the app this week.
- Right below that is the actual graph of the statistics for everyday of the week.
- Finally at the very bottom at the footer will be the tab bar consiting of the Home, Create, Flashlets and Stats.
- From the Flashlet List Page, the user can navigate to the Home, Creating the Flashlets and the users Statistics pages.
