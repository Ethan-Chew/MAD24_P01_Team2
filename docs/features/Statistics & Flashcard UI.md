#Statistics & Flashcard UI
For [Shin's](//https://github.com/Shin-ThantAung) Stage 2 feature, I developed visualization for statistics and improved UI and UX of flashcards.

###Breakdown of Features Developed
These are a list of features developed under my Stage 2 Submission. A full description of each feature will be listed further below.
1. Bar Graph for statistics
2. Swiping gesture and clicking to swipe and flip flashcards
3. Improved UI for flashcards

##Bar Graph for statistics
This feature allows user to see the amount of time spend on flashcards in a week

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">
  <img src="../../images/statisticsGraph.jpg" alt="Image 1" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
</div>
Shows weekly usage of flashcards

##Swiping gesture and clicking to swipe and flip flashcards
This feature allows user to swipe the flashcard and click the flashcard to flip it.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">
  <img src="../../images/flashcards2.jpg" alt="Image 1" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
</div>
If the user swipe on the flashcard, the new flashcard would be displayed.
If the user click on the flashcard, the flashcard would flip showing the back of the card.

##Improved UI for flashcards
The overall UI for flashcard is improved.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">
  <img src="../../images/flashcards2.jpg" alt="Image 1" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
</div>
Buttons to flip and swipe flashcard has been removed and the UI is optimized.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">
  <img src="../../images/flashcardedit2.png" alt="Image 1" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
</div>
Allow the input to expand and scrollable if user put in long texts.
