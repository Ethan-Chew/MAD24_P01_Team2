# Flashcards - Shin Thant

**Flashcards** are for users to use to study. This feature is user created. They make flashcards in the flashlet sets. The flashcards includes the keywords of the users choosing on the front, while the back of the flashcard will contain the description for said keyword. Or the flashcards may contain mini-quizzes with questions in the fron, and answers at the back. 

## Flashcards Keyword/Question Page

- The top left corner of the screen has a back button which the user can press to take them back to the flashlet set home page.
- Below that is the title of the flashlet set, and following that is the front of the flashcard showing either the keyword, or the mini-quiz question.
- The flashcard also shows a 'Edit' button on the top right corner where the user can click to edit the flashcard. As well as a 'flip' button for the user to click to turn the flashcard around to show the description for the keyword, or the answer to the mini-quiz.
- The bottom of that is the back, shuffle and next button. Users can choose between moving on to the next flashcard, or going back to the previous one, or shuffling the flashcards to be random.
