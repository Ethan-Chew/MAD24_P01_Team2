# Flashlet Management - Ethan Chew

**Flashlet** is the term we are using to describe the 'container' for Flashcards. This feauture allows for users to store all the flashcards that they are making, so that its better organised, instead of having all the flashcards in one page they are seperated into different flashlets.

## Flashlet List Page

- This screen shows the list of flashlets that the usre has created.
- The top is a back button where they can go back to the previous page that they were in.
- Right below that is showing that this is the flashlet list page and how many flashlets the user has.
- Following that is the list of flashlets which shows the titles, how many flashcards in the flashlets and when was they last time the flashlet was edited.
- After that is the plus button where users can create more flashlet sets.
- Finally at the very bottom at the footer will be the tab bar consiting of the Home, Create, Flashlets and Stats.
- From the Flashlet List Page, the user can navigate to the Home, Creating the Flashlets and the users Statistics pages.
