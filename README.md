**Quizzzy** is a mobile app designed for productivity and educational use. Users are able to create accounts to manage their studies by allowing users to create flashcards and quizzes (chapters) to test themselves. In addition, organisations can be created to allow for sharing of chapters between users. User statistics tracks a userâ€™s study time, and provides visuals to help users keep track of their studies.  
**App Category:** Education and Productivity  

## Motivation and Objective
Quizzzy can help users to study for their exams using flashcards. Flashcards are an engaging and interactive way to memorise keywords and concepts. By reviewing the keyword, trying to remember its definition, and then flipping the flashcard over, revealing the actual answer, helps memory retention. A flashcard app also allows users to access their flashcards from anywhere, as long as they have their mobile phone. This makes it convenient and portable, we know this also as we ourselves are students and having an app like this could enhance studying for users. 

However, we also acknowledge the issues of having it on a mobile device: users may get distracted when studying. Hence, we are planning to implement a dedicated study mode in Stage 2.

## Design Process

As a team, we used Figma to design the Wireframe for Quizzzy.

### Colours
**Purple** was chosen as our Primary Colour as purple communicates in a positive way. It is said to have the power to uplift, calm nerves and encourage creativity, making it an all-inclusive color. All ages, genders, and cultures can relate to purple.
