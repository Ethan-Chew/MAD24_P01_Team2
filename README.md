# Quizzzy ðŸ“–
**Quizzzy** is a mobile app designed for productivity and educational use. Users are able to create accounts to manage their studies by allowing users to create flashcards and quizzes (chapters) to test themselves. In addition, organisations can be created to allow for sharing of chapters between users. User statistics tracks a userâ€™s study time, and provides visuals to help users keep track of their studies.  
**App Category:** Education and Productivity  

## Motivation and Objective
Quizzzy can help users to study for their exams using flashcards. Flashcards are an engaging and interactive way to memorise keywords and concepts. By reviewing the keyword, trying to remember its definition, and then flipping the flashcard over, revealing the actual answer, helps memory retention. A flashcard app also allows users to access their flashcards from anywhere, as long as they have their mobile phone. This makes it convenient and portable. 

However, we also acknowledge the issues of having it on a mobile device: users may get distracted when studying. Hence, we are planning to implement a dedicated study mode in Stage 2.
